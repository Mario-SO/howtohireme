# Hire Me in 3 Easy Steps! 😎

Welcome to my Hire Me repository, where I've made the hiring process as simple as sending an email! Because who needs complicated hiring procedures, right? 🤷‍♂️

## Step 1: Visit My Portfolio 🌟

**You have to see it to believe it!** Dive into my dazzling portfolio to witness the incredible skills and talents that I bring to the table. From coding wizardry to design mastery, you'll be amazed at what I can do.

## Step 2: Send an E-mail 📧

Now that you're awestruck by my portfolio (who wouldn't be?), it's time for the next step. Send me an email – it's that simple! Just open up your favorite email client, type your message, and hit send. You don't need a carrier pigeon or smoke signals; this is the 21st century, after all! 📨

**Recipient:** [hireme@mariodev.com](mailto:hireme@mariodev.xyz)

**Subject:** Let's Make Magic Happen! ✨

**Message:** Hi there! I was absolutely blown away by your portfolio, and I want to hire you immediately! Would you accept a $1M/year offer? 🚀 I hope it is not too low for you 🥲

## Step 3: Hire Me 💼

Congratulations, you've made it to the grand finale! Once you've sent that email, all that's left to do is sit back, relax, and wait for the magic to happen. Soon, I'll be joining your team and making incredible things together! 💼🌟
